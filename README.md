## Hackathon Challenge Description

### Bluzelle Challenge

Building an instant messenger, powered by the Bluzelle database. 
Here are the requirements:
- An instant messenger that allows users to send textual messages to other users.
- Textual messages should be stored on the Bluzelle network, on a testnet swarm.
- There should be a means to signup, either via email or via mobile phone. Bonus if there is authentication to confirm the person owns that email address or phone number
- The instant messenger can be a web app or mobile app. Bonus for having a mobile app that runs easily on Android or iOS.
- It is not required that the core logic for the instant messenger itself be decentralized, but it is a big bonus if you can demonstrate this (perhaps on a blockchain).

### Noia Network Challenge

### Portal Network Challenge

Building a DApp using Portal Network DApp framework and upload to IPFS and bind a blockchain domain name, powered by the Portal Network.
Here are the requirements:
- Using our react-truffle-metamask framework, or choose your favorite dapp framework
    - This repository is using the React.js, Truffle to build the DApp: [https://github.com/PhyrexTsai/react-truffle-metamask](https://github.com/PhyrexTsai/react-truffle-metamask)
- Using our hackathon uploader to upload your project: [http://h2.portal.network](http://h2.portal.network)
