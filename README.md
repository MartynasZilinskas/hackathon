This is a guide to let you know about Portal Network. And use our tools building a decentralized website/application and hosting on blockchain name service.

## Portal Network Technology

Portal Network include several technology into our ecosystem.

Technology               | Project
-------------------------|:-------------------------------------
Domain Name Service      | ENS, ECNS, WNS
Content Delivery Network | Noia Network
File Storage             | IPFS
Database                 | Bluzelle
Blockchain               | Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Wanchain


### ENS, ECNS, WNS

ENS, ECNS and WNS is the Blockchain Name Services, are distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the each blockchain.

### Noia Network

Noia is a decentralized content delivery network for the new internet.

### IPFS

IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

### Bluzelle

Bluzelle brings together the sharing economy and token economy. Bluzelle enables people to rent out their computer storage space to earn a token while dApp developers pay with a token to have their data stored and managed in the most efficient way.

## Hackathon Challenge Description

Problem of current DNS?
- DNS can be hijacking. DNS hijacking is the practice of subverting the resolution of Domain Name System (DNS) queries. This can be achieved by malware that overrides a computer's TCP/IP configuration to point at a rogue DNS server under the control of an attacker, or through modifying the behaviour of a trusted DNS server so that it does not comply with internet standards.

### Hosting decentralized website/application using Portal Network.

#### Using our react-truffle-metamask framework

#### Using Bluzelle Swarm DB 

#### Using our service upload your hackathon project

- Get your decentralized website/application.
- Get your ENS, ECNS, WNS.
