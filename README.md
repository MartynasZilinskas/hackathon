## Portal Network Technology

Portal Network include several technology into our ecosystem.

Technology               | Project
-------------------------|:-------------------------------------
Domain Name Service      | ENS, ECNS, WNS
Content Delivery Network | Noia Network
File Storage             | IPFS
Database                 | Bluzelle
Blockchain               | Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Wanchain


### ENS, ECNS, WNS

ENS, ECNS and WNS is the Blockchain Name Services, are distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the each blockchain.

### Noia Network

Noia is a decentralized content delivery network for the new internet.

### IPFS

IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

### Bluzelle

Bluzelle brings together the sharing economy and token economy. Bluzelle enables people to rent out their computer storage space to earn a token while dApp developers pay with a token to have their data stored and managed in the most efficient way.

## Hackathon Challenge Description

Problem of current DNS?
- DNS can be hijacking. DNS hijacking is the practice of subverting the resolution of Domain Name System (DNS) queries. This can be achieved by malware that overrides a computer's TCP/IP configuration to point at a rogue DNS server under the control of an attacker, or through modifying the behaviour of a trusted DNS server so that it does not comply with internet standards.

### Challenge 
What is the challenge of Portal Network? Hosting decentralized website/application using Portal Network tools.

#### 1. Using our react-truffle-metamask framework

This repository is using the React.js, Truffle to build the DApp.  
Repository: [https://github.com/PhyrexTsai/react-truffle-metamask](https://github.com/PhyrexTsai/react-truffle-metamask)

#### 2. Using Bluzelle Swarm DB

#### 3. Using our service upload your hackathon project

- Using our hackathon upload page to upload your project: [http://h2.portal.network](http://h2.portal.network)

- Portal Network will help you to build your decentralized website/application.
- Portal Network will give you one of the ENS, ECNS, WNS.

#### 4. Access your decentralized website/application using our browser extension
